# 🔄 ROSCA Pool - Decentralized Rotating Savings and Credit Association

## ❓ What is this project?

**ROSCA Pool** is a decentralized smart contract implementation of a **Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA)** on the Ethereum blockchain.

A ROSCA is a community savings mechanism where a group of people pool money regularly, and members take turns receiving the entire pooled amount in cycles. This helps users save money and access lump sums without relying on banks.

This project brings ROSCA on-chain, creating a **trustless, transparent, and automated savings pool**.

## 🎯 Why build this?

Traditional ROSCAs rely on trust and manual management, which can lead to disputes or fraud.

By implementing ROSCA on blockchain:

- 🔐 **Trustless & Transparent:** Smart contracts enforce rules automatically without intermediaries.
- 🤖 **Automated Cycle Management:** Contributions, payouts, and turns handled by contract logic.
- 🌍 **Global & Permissionless:** Anyone can join securely from anywhere.
- 📜 **Immutable Records:** All transactions stored permanently on-chain.
- ⚡ **Lower Costs & Efficiency:** Removes manual bookkeeping and human error.

This shows how **DeFi** principles can improve community savings and microfinance.
